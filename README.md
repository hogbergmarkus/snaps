## Introduction

[Snaps](https://snaps-frontend-871b3764ee9c.herokuapp.com/) is a photo sharing website,
aimed a people who want to share their photos with others.

As well as uploading your content, all photos uploaded to the website are eligible to be downloaded by any user.

The idea is to create a sharing community where you can either take part in adding content,

or just scroll to enjoy what others have created.

You can also engage in the community through comments and likes, as well as create collections for yourself,

by adding posts to your private albums so you can easily find your favorite posts.

## User Personas

  They like discovering new photography styles and sometimes download an image for personal use.

  They enjoy the ease of being able to save their favorite photos in albums, to find them later.

- The **amateur photographer**, likes to share their photos with others for the feedback.

  They enjoy seeing how their creations are received and the idea of contributing to the community.

  The platform offers them easy uploads and exposure.

  The ability to sort their own and other users content in albums is a big bonus.

## User Goals

### The Casual

They are looking to discover new styles of photography and trends.

Relaxation of scrolling is a large part of why they are here.

### The Amateur Photographer

These users are looking to upload and share their content with the community.

Feedback is important, through likes, comments and seeing how many times their work was downloaded.

The site offers them visibility for their work.

### The Enthusiast

The enthusiast is driven by the curation of beautiful works.

They take pride in finding awesome pieces and collecting them in albums.

## Website Owner Goals

The owner is driven by increasing traffic to the website.

The more users that use the website, they can build out features to make existing users happier,

and at the same time attract new users.

This could mean higher add revenues, and potential subscription features.

The features added have to be selected carefully to not alienate existing users.

The website has to work on both mobile and larger devices for ease of use.

## Design

### Wireframes

The following wireframes were created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

I followed them during my development, though some changes have been made during that process.

![Albums](documentation/wireframes/wireframe_6_albums.png)

### Fonts

My main font used is "Playfair Display SC" which I used for its elegant style.

I paired it with "Gelasio" for input fields and areas with more text, for better readability.

I feel that these fonts in conjunction help create a sense of style and class.

### Colors

I mainly relied on a black and white interface, both for a clean look but also to let the colors

of the images on the website really stand out and take the main stage.
